# go-projects
Will be taking some easy projects from the course gophercises and be doing them on this repository.

While I do them, I'll also add some notes from what I'm studying. Like code notations, and things like that. 

The main source for learning will be:
  * Golang's freecodecampo handbook https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-golang-handbook;
  * Gophercises starter course (which purpose is for taking some simple project ideas) https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises;
  * Notion to take notes of what I learn from the handbook;
